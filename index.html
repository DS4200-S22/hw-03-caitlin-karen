    <h1>HTML+CSS & Marks+Channels</h1>

    <div>
        <div id="container">
            <div class="graph">
                <img class="im" src="img/bubble_and_pie_chart.png">
                <p>In this pie chart, an example of a mark would be the circles, with the circles being items and each
                    slice further detailing each item. Each circle would be considered an area, which would be an item.
                    As for channels, there are the areas (or tilt) of the slices, the color of the slices, and the areas
                    of the pies. Another channel would be the position, which is both horizontal and vertical. This type
                    of pie chart would be ideal for four attributes. Two of the four attributes would be the x- and
                    y-axis, a third would be the size of the circle, and a fourth attribute would represent each
                    percentage of the whole circle. On this given example, there is a quantitative variable on both the
                    x- and y-axis'. The third value is also a quantitative variable that determines the size of the
                    circle relative to the other circle.
                    <br></br>
                    An example of a bubble pie chart would be the average household expenditures of US families across 4
                    years. The x-axis would be categorical, representing each year. The y-axis would represent total
                    expenditure (quantitative). The size of the circles would represent the total expenditure for easy
                    comparison. Finally, each differently colored slice (channel) would represent a proportion of the
                    income spent on various things, such as rent, food, bills, entertainment, transportation, etc.

            <div class="graph">
                <img class="im" src="img/bump_chart.png">
                <p>In this bump chart, an example of a mark would be the points and the lines that show rank changes
                    overtime. The marks each show a node for the points and a connection for the lines. The channels
                    include the colors for the different categories and the horizontal and vertical orientation. Bump
                    charts are best for exploring rank changes overtime, such as most profitable product across multiple
                    years.
                    <br></br>
                    One example is Top 10 best selling artists in the US for a period of 4 years. The color coordination
                    allows users to easily see each category (artist) as it progresses through time. The lines allow
                    readers to easily trace the changes, link the points, and helps users notice drastic drops or gains
                    in rank over a year. A bump chart allows users to clearly identify the changes in popularity between
                    artists throughout the years.
                </p>

            <div class="graph">
                <img class="im" src="img/mind_map.png">
                <p>In this brainstorming map, the marks would be the bubbles that contain the information and the lines
                    that connect the various bubbles. Channels on this diagram include the color scheme for the bubbles,
                    highlighting the different concepts. The bubbles are marks that represent items/nodes, and the lines
                    that form connections between the bubbles would be the links that connect the concepts together. The
                    marks could contain any type of data, since a bubble map is meant to show connections; an example
                    could be Strings that represent a character from a book, or an Object that is made up of or contains
                    another Object.
                    <br></br>
                    An example of a bubble map could be the connections between people. For example, if examining a
                    Northeastern student's Linked-in connections, the student's name would be placed in the center
                    bubble as a String. Then, from each of the student's direct connections, we could color-code the
                    first-level connections with one color (channel) and draw the links from the student to their
                    first-level connections. Then, we could repeat the process for each of the first-level connections
                    to find the student's second-level connections, which can then be color coded again with a different
                    color.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="graph">
                <img class="im" src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png">
                <p>In this stacked bar chart, the thick lines (bars) would represent marks. The channels would be the
                    various colors used to represent parts of a whole, as well as the horizontal categorical orientation
                    and the verical quantitative orientation. An example of a stacked bar chart could be COVID cases by
                    state, with the entire bar representing total cases, and the split bar representing the COVID
                    deaths. This way, users could clearly see the proportion of deaths vs cases per state, as well as
                    the total cases by state. The marks would be an item, but there are no links between the nodes.
                    <br></br>
                    For this, the x-axis must be categorical. Since the chart is a bar chart, the x-axis is, by default,
                    categorical. The y-axis represents some quantitative measure. The bars (marks) would be items, such
                    as each individual case/death or calculated as a sum. The channels would allow the users to mroe
                    clearly distinguish the different representations of deaths and cases.
